# Wiki
This wiki describes patterns and documentation guidelines for all projects.  
It provides guides and instructions on how to develop and maintain the repositories.

## Documentations
- Every repository should include a specification of how it works.
- If a repository depends on a database, it should contain a diagram (e.g., ERD) or documentation describing it.
- Include architecture or sequence diagrams when relevant.

## Commits
- Use `feat:` for new features/changes.
- Use `docs:` for documentation changes.
- Use `config:` for changes in dependencies or configurations and submit via a PR.

## Diagrams
- Keep diagrams in a `/docs/diagrams` folder in each repository.
